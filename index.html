							<h2>About me</h2>

						<div class="content">
							<p><strong></strong> 
								My name is Zach wood and I am a 20 year old from indiana. Outside of software engineering I love to spend time outdoors, 
								and I love sports and I love  to run and go to the gym. I also love to trade stocks and film stuff and edit videos for fun. 
								Before software engineering in highschool i used to stream and post youtube videos in my free time outside of school. 
								Which led me to learn IT in highschool which i found out while working an internship that it did not have enough problem 
								solving for me and was just a lot of paperwork. After this I looked into App Academy and didn't turn back. 
								While at app academy I learned how to build full stack apps from scratch and how to connect a  front end to a back end. 
								I also learned a lot about how to community and how to problem solve. And most importantly I learned how to debug. 
								While at app academy i made a nike clone where you could post new products and they all show on the main page. 
								I am very proud of the way this project looks and helped me grow a lot. Some qualities I love about myself are 
								that I am a very hard worker. I can successfully say at 20 that I had the discipline to make it through a coding 
								bootcamp with no deferrals. I also am a big team player and I love to be a person that helps other people strive 
								in the workplace. At app academy we did pair programming and I made sure I practiced being respectful and helpful 
								whenever my pair did not get something. Lastly, I love my determination. While at app academy I had to deal with 
								my moms surgery at the start and I had to deal with not having a father figure to go to when the program got hard. 
								Through all this though I was able to persevere and finish something I am truly proud of. </p>
